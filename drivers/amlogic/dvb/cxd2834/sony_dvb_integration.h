 \callgraph
 @brief Construct the driver.

        This function is called by the application in order
        to setup the ::sony_dvb_demod_t structure and 
        ::sony_dvb_integration_t::pDemod member.

        This MUST be called before calling ::dvb_integration_Initialize.
        
        Notes on driver configuration:
        - By default, the demodulator uses an inverted AGC.
          If the connected tuner uses a non-inverted IFAGC, call 
          ::dvb_demod_SetConfig with ::DEMOD_CONFIG_IFAGCNEG = 0 to setup 
          the demodulator with postive IFAGC sense, after calling ::dvb_integration_Initialize.
        - By default, the driver enables the RF level monitoring on the 
          device, call ::dvb_demod_SetConfig with ::DEMOD_CONFIG_RFLVMON_ENABLE = 0
          to disable it, after calling ::dvb_integration_Initialize.

 @param pDemod Reference to memory allocated for the demodulator instance. The create 
        function will setup this demodulator instance also.
 @param pDriver The driver to create.

 @brief Performs a blind acquisition to the channel. Blocks the calling thread

        what is meant by "acquisition complete"). 
        Use ::dvb_integration_Cancel to cancel the operation at any time.

        - DVBT: Waits for TPS/TS lock, returns once TPS/TS lock is achieved.
        - DVBT2: Acquisition waits for demod lock (P1/L1-pre/L1-post).
          Once successful, the application can wait for TS lock (::dvb_integration_WaitTSLock)
          to see if the demod is able to decode the PLPs carried on the channel.
          If TS is locked, then the first data PLP in the channel is selected 
          automatically and is output by the demodulator.
          In order to determine the list of data PLPs carried, then use the function 
          ::dvb_demod_monitorT2_DataPLPs.
          Once acquired, use ::dvb_demod_monitorT2_SpectrumSense to see which sense was detected.

        Notes on tuning:
        - DVBT: If using preset tuning (usePresets=1) and the mode/gi information does not match, then 
          the demodulator will FAIL the acquisition.
          If not using preset tuning (usePresets=0), then only the profile (HP/LP) is required for
          tuning. If the LP stream is not available, then the HP stream will be output.
        - DVBT2 only. 
          Only the data PLP ID is required for tuning. In this case, the device will 
          wait for a T2 P1 symbol in order to decode the 
          L1 pre signalling and then begin demodulation.
          If the data PLP ID (::sony_dvbt2_tune_params_t::dataPLPId) or 
          the associated common PLP is not found in the channel, 
          the device will always select the first found PLP and output the associated TS.
          In this case, an indicator in the ::sony_dvbt2_tune_params_t::tuneResult will 
          be set.
